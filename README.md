## Authentication

It is possible to authenticate to ensure that all bugs are considered. In that case an [API key](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=apikey) should be entered as well as the Bugzilla user name.

Note that it is not necessary to provide an API key, in which case only public issues will be considered.
